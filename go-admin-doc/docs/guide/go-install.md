[ðŸšª Experienced users skip ahead](/guide/ksks)

### 1. Download

The official download link is [https://golang.org/dl/](https://golang.org/dl/), where you can select the version appropriate for your operating system. By default, it downloads the latest version:

Once you reach this step, Golang has been successfully installed!

### 3. Verification

Check the Golang version information by running:

```sh
$ go version
go version go1.24.2 darwin/amd64
```

If you see the above output, it means the current working environment has successfully installed `go1.24.2 darwin/amd64`. The word `darwin` indicates MacOS in this case. This output will vary depending on the OS version you installed. It will show differently for Windows and Linux.
