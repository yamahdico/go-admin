## Project Initialization

To improve user experience and reduce user configuration, `go-admin-pro` provides the `install` command to initialize the project, generate configuration files, and create database tables.

```sh
$ go run main.go install
```

This will launch a visual guided installation page for the project. Follow the prompts to complete the setup.

Example pages:

With that, the configuration is complete.
