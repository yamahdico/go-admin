### Edit Template Fields

After confirming, the table structure will be saved in the code generation tool. Now you need to edit the imported data.

### Generate Code

So far, everything is going smoothly with your first program. The next step will be even easier. Click on **Generate Code**, and both frontend and backend code will be placed into their correct locations.

> ⚠️ Note: If you want the generated code to include permissions, choose **Generate Code \[With Permissions]**.
> The only difference is that the version with permissions adds an authentication middleware when registering routes, while the other does not.

After that, restart the frontend service and continue with page display processing.
